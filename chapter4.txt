Chapter 4: The Unseen Battle
Leah awoke to the soft glow of dawn filtering through the wooden shutters. The night had been restless, her dreams filled with strange whispers and unseen movements. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something beyond her understanding was at work.

As she stepped outside, she found Elder Nathan standing near the well, his gaze fixed on the distant hills. “You sense it too, don’t you?” he asked without turning.

Leah nodded. “Something is stirring. It feels like a weight in the air.”

The elder sighed. “The battle is not always seen with the eyes. Forces of light and darkness war over the souls of men. But those who walk in truth will not be overcome.”

She swallowed hard. “But how do we fight something we cannot see?”

Nathan placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. “We stand firm. We speak words of life, not fear. We cling to what is true. The Dominion is not taken by power alone but by unwavering faith.”

Leah knew this was no ordinary struggle. The village was on the edge of something greater, and she was at the center of it. The time had come to choose—fear or faith, darkness or light.

And she would choose wisely.
