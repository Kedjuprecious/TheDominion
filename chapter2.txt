Chapter 2: The Test
The rain fell lightly at first, cool and refreshing against Elias’ skin. But with each passing moment, it grew heavier, and the once golden fields darkened beneath the weight of the storm. The wind howled, bending the trees, and the river in the distance swelled, its surface restless. Yet, in the midst of the chaos, Elias stood firm. He knew this was no ordinary storm—it was a test.

The man in dark robes had vanished as mysteriously as he had appeared, but his words lingered in Elias’ mind. Many before you have claimed this place, but few have kept it.

The words troubled him, not because they made him doubt, but because they made him wonder. If others had tried and failed, what made him different?

Then, the voice returned. Strong, steady, and full of authority.

The land is given, but dominion must be proven.

Elias felt the weight of those words settle deep within him. He had been placed here, but it was not enough to simply exist in this place. He had to walk in authority, or it would be taken from him.

A flash of lightning split the sky, and in that moment, Elias saw movement in the distance. Shadows—dozens of them—emerging from the trees. They moved like men but carried an unnatural stillness, their faces hidden beneath dark hoods. Their presence sent a chill through the air.

Elias’ breath caught. He had no weapon, no armor—only the conviction in his heart. But something told him he would need more than conviction to stand against what was coming.

One figure stepped forward, taller than the rest. His hood fell back, revealing a face sharp and angular, his eyes burning with an unnatural light. He smiled, but it was not a smile of kindness—it was a challenge.

You stand on land you cannot keep, the figure said, his voice calm yet full of menace. Turn back now, and you may walk away unharmed.

Elias steadied himself. I will not turn back.

The figure tilted his head, amused. Then tell me, young one—what makes you worthy to rule here?

Elias did not answer immediately. The storm raged around him, but he listened beyond the wind, beyond the rain. And then, he spoke.

I was placed here. His voice was steady. Not by my own will, but by One greater than me. The land is not mine because I take it. It is mine because it was given.

The figure’s expression darkened. Then prove it.

The shadows surged forward.

Elias had no time to think. His body moved before his mind could catch up. He ducked the first attack, his instincts sharper than they had ever been. He spun, avoiding a second strike, and then—without knowing how—he reached out and struck.

Light exploded from his hand.

The shadow recoiled, its form breaking apart like smoke in the wind. The others hesitated.

Elias stared at his hand. The light still flickered in his palm, as though waiting to be commanded.

The tall figure narrowed his eyes. Interesting.

He raised his hand, and the ground beneath Elias trembled. A force unseen yet powerful pressed against him, trying to push him down. Elias gritted his teeth. He would not bow.

The voice returned, stronger this time.

Stand. Speak.

Elias took a breath and raised his own voice. I was given dominion. And I will not be moved.

The pressure shattered. The ground steadied. And the light in Elias’ hand surged, no longer a flicker but a flame.

The shadows faltered. The tall figure took a step back, his expression unreadable. Then, slowly, he smiled.

This is only the beginning, he said. And then, just like that, the shadows disappeared, swallowed by the storm.

The wind died. The rain slowed. The land was silent once more.

Elias exhaled, his body trembling, not with fear, but with something else—power. He had stood. He had spoken. And the darkness had fled.

He turned his gaze to the horizon. He knew now that this battle was not just for land. It was for something far greater.

And he was ready.
